      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Sindhuja, a full-stack developer who writes code by day and debugs it by night. My expertise lies in creating 
        scalable solutions and translating caffeine into innovative applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a Master's degree in Computer Science, a passion for problem-solving, and a keyboard that fears no bugs, 
        I thrive in environments where collaboration and creativity shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career goal? To automate anything that’s repetitive and to keep my code as clean as my desk pretends to be. 
        When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, experimenting with new tools, or pretending 
        to understand every line of a tech blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: I have an impressive collection of self-help books—so impressive that I occasionally think I’m a life coach.
